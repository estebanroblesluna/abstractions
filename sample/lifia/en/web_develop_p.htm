    <td height="282" valign="top" class="texto_negro"><span class="texto_negro">Internet-based information systems have become popular in the last few years as an efficient way to obtain remote and friendly access to distributed information sources . These systems combine mature, well-known software technologies: server-based databases and applications, and client-based GUIs. In many cases they involve specific devices (such as mobile artifacts).<br>
The &quot;novelty&quot; in these applications is the capability to add navigation and roaming access to the transactional behavior typical of business applications. Navigation and the possibility of access at all times and from all places are the main attractions of software on the Internet. The success of e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com is not due to the fact that one can buy or sell but mainly because it is easy to find what we want, we can even access the site from a small cell phone, and the site provides customized information such as advice and suggestions. Aside from the need to carefully design and implement the necessary databases and application programs, these kinds of applications require certain specific design activities, such as navigation and interface design. Fortunately, in the past the hypermedia community has studied many of the problems related to this specific type of applications (though, obviously, many new problems appeared with the Internet, for example those related to mobility and &quot;pervasiveness&quot;). </span></td>

    <td height="200" valign="top" class="texto_negro">At LIFIA we have been developing hypermedia methods and applications for more than ten years. We are pioneers in this area in Argentina (our first hypertext commercial system was delivered in 1989) and the OOHDM (Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method) is one of the most mature, recognized by the international community.<br>
OOHDM is a method for designing hypermedia applications, particularly software in the Internet. Developed jointly by researchers at LIFIA and PUC-Rio, Brazil, it is highly regarded by the technical community and has been used to implement many commercial applications in the Internet.<br>
Navigational patterns and interfaces: Applying the idea of patterns to the development of software on the Internet and to hypermedia applications in general is attractive but it remained almost unexplored until 1997. We introduced the concept in 1995 and generalized it in 1997. Since then, LIFIA has carried out important work related to the discovery and use of recurring design structures in the Internet (particularly in e-commerce applications). All patterns were presented and evaluated at PLoP (Pattern Languages of Programs) and EuroPLoP, the &quot;official&quot; conferences on patterns, and Addison Wesley published many of them in its edition of &quot;Pattern Languages of Program Design&quot;.<br>
A slightly different set of models, though related to the above-mentioned ones, was developed in the areas of collaborative hypermedia and virtual environments (both in the context of Internet applications).
<p>&bull; Quality Control: a Quality Control Methodology (WebQEM) was developed in association with researchers from the University of La Pampa, Argentina.<br>
  &bull; Mobile Applications and personalization: LIFIA has developed two tools related to the development of hypermedia and Web applications, OONavigator and OOHDMCase, and we are developing Web Services in the areas of customizing and mobility.<br>
  &bull; OONavigator: This is a framework implemented in VisualWorks that improves the interfaces of object-oriented applications with hypermedia capabilities. Developed in 1994 (before the Web entered into generalized use), it has been improved for developing of Web applications. OONavigator surpasses the functionality of similar development platforms (such as VisualWorks) by explicitly recognizing navigation as a &quot;first-class&quot; application behaviour.<br>
  &bull; OOHDMCase: This is a Case environment which supports the OOHDM methodology and allows deployment in different platforms (Toolbook, HTML pages, etc.) Mainly applied to study the feasibility of use of Case tools in the development of Web applications. </p></td>
